This code creates a neural network that predicts, whether the face on a picture is happy or sad.

For the training it uses 40 images of happy faces and 40 images of sad faces (that I drew myself), they are also uploaded into the github folder (**neural_networks_python/9. happy and sad faces for the face recognition NN (smiles_data).7z**)

For the inference (when it applies all the learned weights and biases to another set of data) it uses another 10 happy faces and 10 sad faces I drew as well.

**The key parts of the code:**

**Training:**
1) It uses the module Image of the Python Image Library (PIL) to import and change the images of happy and sad faces
2) It uses leaky_relu for the hidden layers (because I'm scared of dead neurons:D), and sigmoid function for the output layer (because the NN needs to categorize the output data, and if I use linear activations, it just outputs data that is more difficult to understand, so sigmoid turns that data into values between 0 and 1, that is very convenient)
3) training input images (80 samples, with resolution 50x50) are turned into almost same images (with removed gray colors) and then into matrices 50x50. Then they are stacked vertically, so that first 40 faces are happy, and 2nd 40 are sad.
4) the target array is organized accordinly: 1st 40 elements are [1], and 2nd 40 elements are [0]. Then the program tries to understand matches between these 2 arrays.
5) forwad pass and backpropagation are standard, nothing really unusual
6) during training the program outputs epochs and corresponding mean squared error (MSE, the loss function) to clearly see the process
7) the training stops, when the certain value of MSE is achieved

**Inference:**

8) During inference program does the same forward pass, but with training data and learned weights. Then it transforms zeros and ones from the output of the sigmoid function into "happy face" and "sad face" values.

**Performance**

The program performs well in 19/20 cases. It constantly says (with no exceptions) that one sad face is happy. Most likely, it's because of the slightly distorted mouth shape of that smile. Also it does a mistake in defining another face (probably for the same reason), especially if I reduce the number of neurons, but it's rare.
